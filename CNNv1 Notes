#Hyperparameter Notes
LR:
-LR of 0.001: very slow, val accuracy stalled at 2.5% after ~10 epochs
-LR of 0.01 [Current]: seems good, gets to 15-20% in ~20 epochs, ~24% in ~100 epochs
-LR of 0.1: Too high, bounces around

Batch Size:
-Batch Size of 4:
-Batch Size of 16:
-Batch Size of 32:
-Batch Size of 64 [Current]:

#Model Notes
Layers:
-Linear [Current]:
-Softmax (re-test): broke everything
-Batch norm (untested):
-Ave pool (untested):
-Max pool (untested) [Current]:

#Image Transform Notes
All:
-Resize 500*500: slow
-Resize 256*256 [Current]: quicker, no difference in accuracy
Train:
-RandomRotation        \
-RandomHorizontalFlip  | - [Current]: Brought train, val, and test acc closer together, 
-ColourJitter          /              increased test acc 
-GaussianBlur
-RandomAffine
-RandomAdjustSharpness
-RandomAutocontrast
-RandomPerspective
-TrivialAugment
-RandAugment
-Shuffle True
Val:
-No transform
-Shuffel False [Current]: Don't shuffle so only change is the model
Test:
-No transform
-Shuffel False [Current]: Don't shuffle so only change is the model

#Loss and Optimiser Notes
Optimiser:
-SGD: 
-Adam [Current]: Seems to increase accuracy more stabily
