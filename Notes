#Hyperparameter Notes
LR:
-LR of 0.001 is very slow, val accuracy stalled at 2.5% after ~10 epochs
-LR of 0.01 [Current] seems good, gets to 15-20% in ~20 epochs 
-LR of 0.1 (untested)

Batch Size:
-Batch Size of 4
-Batch Size of 16
-Batch Size of 32
-Batch Size of 64 [Current]

#Model Notes
Layers:
-Linear [Current]
-Softmax (re-test)
-Batch norm (untested)
-Ave pool (untested)
-Max pool (untested) [Current]

#Image Transform Notes
All:
-Resize 500*500 is slow
-Resize 256*256 [Current] is quicker, no difference in accuracy
Train:
-Random rotation        \
-Random horizontal flip  | - [Current] Brought train, val, and test acc closer together, 
-Colour jitter           |             increased test acc
-Shuffle True           /
Val:
-No transform
-Shuffel False [Current]
Test:
-No transform
-Suffel False [Current]
